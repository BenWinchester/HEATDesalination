# Each optimisation listed under the top-level header `optimisations` contains
# inforamtion on the bounds, constraints and the criterion which is being
# optimised for.
#
# Valid bounds:
# - buffer_tank_capacity:
#     The capacity in kg of the buffer tank.
# - mass_flow_rate:
#     The HTF mass flow rate.
# - pv:
#     The PV-panel capacity.
# - pv_t:
#     The PV-T system size.
# - start_hour:
#     The start hour for the plant.
# - st:
#     The solar-thermal system size.
# - storage:
#     The battery capacity.
#
# Valid constraints/criteria:
# - auxiliary_heating_fraction:
#     The fraction of the heating demand that was met using auxiliary heating.
# - lcue:
#     The levilised cost of used electricity.
# - renewable_heating_fraction:
#     The fraction of the heating which was met using renewables.
# - renewable_electricity_fraction:
#     The fraction of the electricity which was met using renewables.
# - total_cost:
#     The total cost of the system components whose sizes were optimisable.
# - unmet_electricity_fraction:
#     The fraction of the electricity demand which was unmet.
#
# Each "bounds" entry can contain either `max` and `min` information, providing
# the maximum and minimum bounds on the parameter being optimised, or `fixed` if
# the parameter is should not be optimised. E.G.,
# bounds:
#   - pv:
#       initial_guess: 20
#       min: 5
#       max: null
#   - htf_mass_flow_rate:
#       fixed: 4
# which would correspond to the PV collectors being optimised with a minimum of
# 5 collectors and no upper-bound, and with the htf mass flow rate being fixed
# at 4 kg/s through the system overall.
#
